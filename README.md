This is my first Git Repository

This project is a simple Amazon homepage clone made with HTML and CSS. It features a top navigation bar with logo, search, account, returns, and cart, followed by a panel of quick links. A hero banner highlights offers, while product boxes showcase items in a grid. The footer provides links, company info, and copyright details
